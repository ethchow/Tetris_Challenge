# Tetris_Challenge
--------------------
TASK: Create a Python algorithm that returned a solution of tetromino pieces to fill a randomly generated polyomino region.
--------------------
The Tetrimino solution I came up with, was able to find an accurate and fast solution to a randomly generated pattern of tetriminoes. It took a matrix of unsolved pieces, and categorised it into 17 different pieces and selected the optimum piece for the solution, so that no block were left unmatched.

It resulted with an accuracy average of 95%, with run speeds of 1000x1000 squares being less than 8 seconds.
